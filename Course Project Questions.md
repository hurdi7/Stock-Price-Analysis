<ul>
<li>Estimate a regression model using the given data. </li>
<li>Plot the residuals obtained and see if you observe any systematic pattern. </li>
<li>Use the DW test (in Excel hand calculation approach) to find out if the error variance is auto correlated. </li>
<li>Use the Cochrane-Orcutt two-stage procedure and obtain the estimates of the feasible GLS. </li>
<li>If the ϱ (rho) estimated from the Cochrane-Orcutt method differs substantially from that estimated from the DW statistic, which method of estimating ϱ would you choose and why? </li>
</ul>
