# Stock-Price-Analysis
Stock Price Analysis | Course Project: (Prof. Krittika Banerjee) Using prices of a stock across 3 years

•	Made a regression model using opening & closing price and volume of a stock, R² = 0.99, but significant positive autocorrelation<br>
•	Applied Cochrane Orcutt 2 step procedure to adjust the model for autocorrelation in error term, using GLS and getting rho = 0.2<br>
•	Conducted functional form testing and model specification analysis using residual plots, robust errors, and omitted variable testing<br>

Used Stata to get results from this dataset.
